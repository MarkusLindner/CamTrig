# CamTrig

This Project is about triggering highspeed cameras in an engine tests bench environment.

The hardware is based on an Arduino Mega 2560.

Camera triggering is realised with an BNC-Signal between 0 and 5 Volt.

The signals provided from the test bench come from an AVL Crank Angle Encoder.
